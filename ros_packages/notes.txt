My Notes

Looked at the difference between catkin build and catkin_make.
- Seems like catkin build is a powered-up version of catkin_make with a bunch
  of extra cool features

Conda env:
ros_macgyver

Sourcing environment
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

source devel/setup.bash

I learned to use catkin build instead of catkin_make. 
I had to install empy (pip install empy) and yaml (pip install pyyaml) to get
various pieces to work.sour

Looks like I need Mongo DB

Rosplan demos
git clone https://github.com/KCL-Planning/rosplan_demos.git

Occupancy grid
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils.git

Mongodb_store
git clone https://github.com/strands-project/mongodb_store.git

AAHHHH. Rosplan_demo worked without Anaconda. 

Another useful package that I think could be good for us at some point
